# Cassandra Practical Works

This directory is used to mount volumes of each server configuration, 
so you can change the configuration on the fly and reload the servers.

Each directory is specific for each cluster server.

All files are default so far.
You might want to start looking at `cassandra.yaml` in each subdirectory.
